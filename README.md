# To-display-each-character-from-a-string-using-sequence-index

This simple Python script demonstrates how to access and display each character in a string using index positions and a loop.

# What This Program Does

- Takes a predefined string ("Hello")

- Finds its length using len()

- Displays each character using a for loop and index

- Also demonstrates accessing characters using specific index values

- Shows what happens when accessing an index that is out of range

# Output Explanation 

- Characters at index 0 to 4 will print normally.

- Trying to print a[5] will raise:

   *IndexError: string index out of range*

# Learning Points

- Strings in Python are indexed starting from 0.

- You can access characters using string[index].

- Using an index outside the valid range causes an IndexError.
